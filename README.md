## Where can the game be played?

## How does your game satisfy all of the experience requirements?
The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player in the form of a click, and a drag. The player can either click on a ball to move it and then click on the ball again to set it down, or click and drag the ball the shoot it. Additionally, the player has to use the physics of the ball arcing and moving to score points. This is done by shooting one ball, and hitting it with another ball. Once the ball is shot, physics are applied to it for unique outcomes. The game boasts 3 physics gameplay scenes, each with a slightly unique twist on the same premise. There are also 3 additional scenes that contextualize your actions in the physics scene by giving you a score.

## Did you make any assets>
No. I did not. All of the assets were made in engine.

## How do you play the game?
The goal of the game is to make the balls collide. There is one red ball and one green ball. When the balls collide, a score is generated in the next scene. The score is dependant in the total displacement of the red ball and how fast the red ball was moving before it collided with the green ball. If the player wants to try a scene again there is a rety button, and if they want to see their score they must go to the next scene. Click on a ball to move it with your mouse, and then click on it again to place it back down. Click and drag the ball to shoot it away from the mouse.
