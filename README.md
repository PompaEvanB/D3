## Where can the game be played?

## How does your game satisfy all of the experience requirements?
The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player in the form of a click, and a drag. The player can either click on a ball to move it and then click on the ball again to set it down, or click and drag the ball the shoot it. Additionally, the player has to use the physics of the ball arcing and moving to score points. This is done by shooting one ball, and hitting it with another ball. Once the ball is shot, physics are applied to it for unique outcomes. The game boasts 3 physics gameplay scenes, each with a slightly unique twist on the same premise. There are also 3 additional scenes that contextualize your actions in the physics scene by giving you a score.
